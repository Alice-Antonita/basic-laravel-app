### How to deploy the app ###
You need to install PHP and Composer. The following documentation https://laravel.com/docs/11.x provides the required steps to do so.

Then, clone the project and start Laravel's local development server using Laravel Artisan's serve command:

php artisan serve

Once you have started the Artisan development server, the application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8000.
